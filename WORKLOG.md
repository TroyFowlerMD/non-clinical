### 2026-05-19 - Codex desktop - Psych Scheduler feedback and PTO-feasible filter
- Completed: Restored the feedback modal to a dual-path submission model: FormSubmit email plus the maintenance-request Apps Script logger, with the logger sent in a no-CORS-compatible way so FormSubmit failure does not strand the request.
- Completed: Added a My Schedule "Show only PTO feasible" table-control button that filters the selected provider's schedule to rows where `ptoRisk === 'Feasible'`.
- Completed: Verified JavaScript syntax with the bundled Node REPL, loaded the app locally from the live Google Sheet, confirmed the PTO filter changes the current table count from 112 dates to 6 dates, confirmed the new button is visible at a 375px viewport, and submitted one Codex-labeled feedback test that produced the success message.
- In progress: Existing active mobile-vs-desktop divergence task remains open.
- Blockers/notes: `AGENTS.md` already had an uncommitted edit before this work began, so commit/push was not performed automatically.
